About
BG3 Lazy Tailor is a Blender addon that takes the tedium out of refitting outfits to the different body types present in Balder's Gate 3. Lazy Tailor works by taking an already fully weight painted outfit, then using those weights and a specially tailored rig, it morphs the outfit's current body type to match the shape of another body type based on a user specified pre-set. This method is both non-destructive and extremely flexible, as you are able to then tweak the resulting transformation to your liking before finalising the appearance. You are also absolutely not limited to the pre-sets that come with the addon as it fully supports the creation and use of custom pre-sets.

Lazy Tailor's method has benfits over more over "traditional" methods of refitting outfits (such as transferring shape keys form one mesh to another), as it provides more consistent and repeatable results, while also giving you more dynamic control over the final shape. But the main benefit is that the method keeps the existing weight painting more or less intact, meaning that you often have to make very little adjustments when fitting between body types. To demonstrate just how quick and easy lazy Tailor is, here is a short video cycling through the default per-sets that come with the addon:

Please bear in mind that that there is no 'one size fits all' approach to refitting an outfit, some have different requirements than others; that said, Lazy Tailor will help you in getting the bulk of the work done quickly and efficiently, saving you large amounts of time and help prevent the onset of carpal tunnel syndrome. If you have any feedback, suggestions, or questions(that where not covered in the provided addon guide) please feel free to reach out to me here or via one of my socials.
And if you have made anything with Lazy Tailor, I would love to see it!
