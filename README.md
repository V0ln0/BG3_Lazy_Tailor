BG3 Lazy Tailor is an unoffical modding resource for Baldur's Gate 3. 
Its goal is to take the tedium out of refitting outfits in Blender for different for the various body types present in the game by making the process both quicker and easier.
Lazy Tailor works first by snapping the positions of bones in the current body's armature to their counterparts in the target body's armature. Then, it applies a pre-set "pose" to a specialised controller rig, which allows for more accurate control over the final shape. 
Once the pre-set has been applied the user is then able to use the rig themselves to achieve their desired result. An added bonus of refitting the mesh this way is that in some cases the mesh's weight painting dose not have to be redone, though that is situational.
